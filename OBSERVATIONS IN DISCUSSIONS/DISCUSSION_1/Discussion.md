## 1.) $SHELL

    $SHELL contains the absolute path of the binary of your current shell.

    Each and every command or shell in linux has a binary (the file containing executable code) associated with it.

    The binaries are not created/modified or saved when you run the commands.

    These binaries are always present in your linux system. Whenever you type any command on the shell, 
    it invokes the binary of that command and executes it.

    To know where the binary of a specific command is present, we can use which command.

    For example:
    which echo
    which cat
